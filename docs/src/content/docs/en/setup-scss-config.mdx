## How to use the configurable SCSS file

It seems that there is currently no way to use the [SASS module system](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules) directly within Astro files.

*Please correct me if this should be different and open a [Github issue](https://github.com/felix-berlin/astro-breadcrumbs/issues).*

### 1. Install the SASS Pre-processors

If already present this is optional.

```bash
npm add -D sass
```

### 2. Create a new SCSS file

Create a new SCSS file (for example styles.scss) in your project and import the `astro-breadcrumbs` SCSS file. You can then use the SCSS variables to customize the look of the breadcrumbs.

```scss

```scss
@use 'astro-breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs.scss' with (
  /// Your config here
);
```

### 3. Import the SCSS file in your Astro file

```astro
---
import "../styles/styles.scss";
---
```
